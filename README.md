# OOP-tutorial

A very simple program just to demonstrate the four pillars/principles of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

Some descriptions/requirements of the program are the following: \
  a) Book, Souvenir, and Jewelry is a "Thing" \
  b) The user must be able to see the different "Things" through a list \
  c) A user may add a new "Thing" to the list \
  d) A user can choose which type of "Thing" to display in the list \
  e) A user can search through the list of "Things" \
  f) A user may choose to sort the "Things" in ascending or descending order \
  g) A user may choose to group the "Things" by its name, itemId, or value
